## TMDB Box Office Revenue Prediction
The movie industry makes billions of dollars across the world. The success of these movies, however, is not universal. Some crash at the box office, costing the production company or companies paying for the film millions of dollars while others enjoy hugely successful revenues. The goal of our project is to predict what movies will fail or succeed and to identify key factors in box office success.
